# gRPC Overview in Python
This repository contains a simple example of a gRPC implementation. For more information about this project in particular visit the gRPC's website.

## About the example
 I divided the projects into sub-folders in case I will do more tests later, so far the repository consists of the "basics" and the "caf√©". The first one was following the example from the documentation, the latter is an expanded version of it that I build while trying out the features. Both are a unary RPC. In their folders you will find some auto-generated files as well as our client, server and most importantly - the proto file.

## Run the project
To run the project you need to make sure that you have installed the required packages, all defined in the requirements.txt file.
1. Start with:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   
2. Next, you will need two terminals, one for the server and another one for the client. Then run:
   ```shell
    python <project name>_server.py
    ```
   ```shell
    python <project name>_client.py
    ```
